Background:  Dave and Wife Kelsey. Dave used to be a developer. Kelsey still works as a QA tester. Dave is at home with the tv on. Kelsey is between the kitchen and Dave looking after medication and making a drink and dealing with phone calls from medical people. The TV is loud and needs turning down at pne point. Dave wlll grunt when needs something and then speaks quietly to Kelsey. Often Dave is in pain with neck or has temperature reg difficulties so will need a blankey or window opening or fan on. uses a neck brace but hates it. has a vent mask. neck often forcing head down. Dave not using aac. imagine now a long period of time say over 30 minutes and imagine their dialogue. Dave will have reduced length of utterance as gets fatigued quickly

**Setting:** *The living room. Late afternoon. The TV is blaring a chaotic advertisement. Dave is slumped in his chair, his neck brace pushing his chin up slightly, but his head is still heavy. Kelsey is pacing in the hallway, visible through the door.*

---

**(Time: 00:00)**

**Kelsey:** *(Into phone, voice tight)* I know he needs the liquid form. He can’t swallow the tablets... No, crushing them blocks the tube... Look, can you just ring the pharmacy yourself? I can't keep being the middleman.

*Dave is grimacing. The noise from the TV is physically painful for him. He takes a deep breath to prepare himself to speak.*

**Dave:** *(Voice quiet, slurrying slightly)* Kelsey, can you... turn the... thing down... please.

*The TV noise drowns him out. Kelsey doesn't hear. She’s listening to the person on the phone.*

**Dave:** *(Louder, straining)* Kelsey. Turn... it... down.

**Kelsey:** *(Covering the phone, poking her head in)* Sorry, love? Did you say something?

*Dave closes his eyes. He doesn't have the air to say the whole sentence again.*

**Dave:** TV. Down.

**Kelsey:** Oh, god, sorry.

*She rushes in, grabs the remote, and mutes it completely. She goes back to the phone.*

**(Time: 00:08)**

*Kelsey hangs up and walks into the room, looking exhausted. She starts tidying up empty vibe-feed syringes from the side table.*

**Kelsey:** Pharmacy are sorting it. They said they’ll deliver by six.

**Dave:** *(Takes a breath)* I don’t think... I don’t think that driver knows... where the house is.

**Kelsey:** *(Pausing)* Say again? I missed the start.

*Dave looks frustrated. He tries to repeat the full sentence but runs out of air halfway through.*

**Dave:** The driver... he doesn't... *(gasps for air)*... he gets lost.

**Kelsey:** The delivery driver? From last time?

**Dave:** *(Nods, giving up on the sentence)* Lost. Watch for him.

**Kelsey:** Okay. I’ll keep my phone on me. Do you want a tea while I’m up?

**Dave:** No. Water.

**(Time: 00:15)**

*Kelsey helps him take a sip of water through a long straw. He coughs weakly after the swallow. He leans his head back, but the brace resists. He starts shifting his hips, uncomfortable.*

**Dave:** This brace is... it's really digging into... the back of my neck today.

**Kelsey:** Is it? Let me see.

**Dave:** It feels like... it's cutting... cutting in.

**Kelsey:** You’re mumbling a bit, D. I can’t hear you. Where does it hurt?

*Dave sighs through his nose. The effort to articulate the specific sensation is too much.*

**Dave:** Brace. Hurting.

**Kelsey:** The back or the chin?

**Dave:** Back. Move it.

*Kelsey gently unstraps the back of the collar and shifts the foam padding.*

**Kelsey:** Is that the spot?

**Dave:** Yeah. There. Leave it.

**(Time: 00:22)**

*Dave starts sweating. His face flushes red. He tries to lift a hand to gesture at the window but can only wiggle his fingers on the armrest.*

**Dave:** Is it... is it really hot in here... or is it just me?

**Kelsey:** *(Looking up from her laptop)* It’s actually quite chilly. Are you overheating?

**Dave:** *(Breathing faster)* Just... feels like... burning up. Open the...

**Kelsey:** Open the window?

**Dave:** *(Nods)* Please.

*Kelsey opens the window. A gust of wind blows the curtains. She looks at him concerned.*

**Dave:** Fan too.

**Kelsey:** You sure?

**Dave:** *(Impatient grunt)* Fan. On.

*She switches the fan on. He closes his eyes, letting the air hit his face.*

**(Time: 00:30)**

*Eight minutes later. The cold air has done its job, but now Dave is shivering. His lips have lost a bit of color. He looks incredibly tired; the effort of regulating his temperature has drained his battery.*

**Kelsey:** You’re shaking. Do you want the window shut now?

**Dave:** *(Attempts a sentence)* Yeah, shut it... and get the... get the blanket.

**Kelsey:** Shut it and what?

*Dave doesn't try to repeat the sentence. He just looks at his legs.*

**Dave:** Window shut. Blanket.

*Kelsey shuts the window and tucks a fleece blanket around him. She lingers, smoothing it out.*

**Kelsey:** How’s the breathing? You sound a bit shallow.

**Dave:** *(Softly)* Struggling... a bit. To catch... it.

**Kelsey:** Do you want the mask on for a bit? Give your lungs a break?

*Dave nods slowly. He doesn't attempt a sentence.*

**Dave:** Mask.

*Kelsey fits the ventilation mask over his nose and mouth. He flinches as the pressure starts, then settles. The machine hums. He looks at her, his eyes signalling he needs one last thing.*

**Kelsey:** What is it?

*He tries to speak through the mask, which muffles his voice.*

**Dave:** *(Muffled)* Hand.

**Kelsey:** *(Smiling sadly)* Oh.

*She takes his hand and squeezes it. He relaxes into the chair.*

Next Scene

ok now Dave has a mum  -Dawn. Kelsey has a child from a previous marriage. Dawn likes knitting and sees Dave a couple of times a week and will try and FaceTime at other times. Dawn and Kelsey get on but someties finds it a struggle to deal with Dawns eotional difficulties on top of her own. There are often medical professionals coming in. 

I now want you to imagine a new scene where a health worker (a specialist nurse to look at dwaunes pressure and medication) pops in whilstaDave on a facetime call with mum and Kelsey helping - and juggling other things - to be Daves voice as lipreading over facetime difficult particularly with Daves neck. It becoes more of a one sided conversation. 

--

Setting: The living room. Mid-morning. The TV is off, but the room is cluttered with medical boxes and a child’s school bag on the floor. Kelsey is hovering, holding an iPad up so Dave can see the screen. Dave is in his chair, head slumped forward, the neck brace pressing his cheeks up. On the iPad screen, Dawn is close to the camera, holding up a ball of lilac wool.

Nurse (Sarah): Kneeling beside Dave’s chair, putting on blue gloves.

(Time: 00:00)

Dawn: (On iPad, loud and tinny) ...and I told the woman at the haberdashery, I said, "If I purl this, it’s going to look ridiculous," but she wasn't listening. Does that look too purple to you, love?

Dave strains to lift his eyes to the screen without lifting his head.

Dave: (Takes a breath, voice weak) It looks... it looks a bit... bright to me, Mum.

Dawn: What’s that? I can’t see his mouth, Kelsey. Is he frozen?

Kelsey: (Sighs, shifting the iPad) No, Dawn, he’s just tired. He said it looks a bit bright.

Dawn: Bright? It’s lilac! It’s supposed to be soothing. Oh, he looks very flushed, Kelsey. Is he feverish?

Nurse Sarah: (Softly, to Kelsey) I need to check the pressure area on his hip. Can we tilt him?

Kelsey: (To Sarah) Just one sec. (To Dawn) Mum, the Nurse is here. Sarah. She needs to check his skin.

Dawn: Oh, hello! Ask her about that red mark on his heel. I saw it last Tuesday.

Kelsey: (To Sarah) His Mum says check the heel.

Nurse Sarah: Heel is healing nicely. Dave, I’m going to recline you now, okay?

Dave: (Nods) Okay.

(Time: 00:05)

The chair whirs and tilts back. Kelsey has to tilt the iPad awkwardly to keep Dave in the frame, but mostly Dawn gets a view of the ceiling.

Dawn: I can’t see him. I’m looking at the lampshade.

Dave: (Straining) Kelsey... tell her... tell her I’m still here.

Kelsey: He’s still here, Mum. We’re just doing the checks.

Nurse Sarah: (Lifting Dave’s leg) Skin looks intact here. Dave, have you felt any stinging on the right side?

Dave tries to answer the nurse while Dawn is still talking.

Dawn: ...because if his heels break down, that’s it, isn't it? My neighbour’s husband had that. Terrible business.

Dave: (To Nurse, attempting a sentence) It feels... a bit sore when I... when I sleep on it.

His voice is too quiet. The Nurse looks to Kelsey.

Kelsey: (Interpreting) He says it’s sore when he sleeps on that side.

Nurse Sarah: Okay. We might need to adjust the air mattress setting.

Dawn: What did he say? Is it bad? He looks like he’s grimacing.

Kelsey: (Stressed) Mum, he’s grimacing because we’re moving him. He said his hip is a bit sore.

(Time: 00:10)

Dawn: (Voice wavering, tearful) Oh, love. You go through so much. It breaks my heart, it really does. I was crying to your Auntie Jean about it yesterday.

Dave squeezes his eyes shut. He hates when she gets upset. He tries to reassure her.

Dave: (Mustering energy) Mum... please don’t... don’t get upset... I’m fine.

Dawn: What? I didn't catch that. The signal went funny.

Kelsey: (Patiently, but tight) He said don't get upset. He’s fine.

Dave: (Quieter) Fine.

Nurse Sarah: Okay, bringing you back up, Dave. Sorry for the motion.

The chair rises. Dave’s head flops forward heavily as gravity takes hold again. He looks exhausted.

Nurse Sarah: I need to check the syringe driver site on his arm.

Kelsey: (To Dawn) Mum, Sarah needs to get to his arm. I’m going to have to put the iPad down for a minute.

Dawn: Can’t you prop me up against the tea pot? I just want to see his face. I haven't seen him properly all week.

Kelsey hesitates. She looks at Dave. He looks drained.

Dave: (Barely audible) Just... do it. Prop her.

Kelsey props the iPad against a box of medication on the coffee table. The angle is bad—up Dave’s nose—and he can’t really see her.

(Time: 00:15)

Nurse Sarah: (Checking the arm) This looks a little red. Dave, is this itchy?

Dave: Itchy. Yeah.

Dawn: (From the table) Why is nobody talking? Is something wrong with his arm? Kelsey?

Kelsey: (While holding Dave’s sleeve up) Just checking the site, Mum. It’s a bit red.

Dawn: Is it infected? Oh god.

Dave: (To Kelsey, urgency in his eyes) Tell her... stop.

Kelsey: Mum, it’s not infected. Please don't panic.

Nurse Sarah: It’s just a reaction to the dressing adhesive. I’ll change it to the silicone one.

Dave: Silicone. Good.

Dawn: I wish I could do something. I feel so useless just sitting here with my knitting. Does he want me to come over? I can get the bus.

Dave looks at Kelsey. The look says 'No'. He doesn't have the energy for a visit.

Dave: (Short breath) No visit. Too... tired.

Kelsey: (Softening the blow) He’s really knackered today, Mum. I think he just needs to sleep after Sarah goes.

Dawn: (Hurt) Oh. Right. I suppose I’m in the way.

Dave: (Frustrated, trying to fix it) No... just... no energy.

Kelsey: He says he’s just got no energy, Mum. It’s not you.

(Time: 00:20)

Nurse Sarah: Right, I’m all done, Dave. I’ll organize the new dressings. I’ll let myself out, Kelsey.

Kelsey: Thanks, Sarah.

Sarah leaves. Kelsey picks the iPad back up. Dave is slumping significantly now.

Dawn: Has she gone? She seemed in a rush.

Kelsey: She’s busy, Mum.

Dave: (Eyes closing) Kell... end it.

Kelsey: (Whispering to Dave) You want to go?

Dave: (Nods) Sleep.

Kelsey: (To Dawn) Mum, I’m going to have to let you go. He’s drifting off.

Dawn: Already? We’ve only had ten minutes.

Dave: Love you. Bye.

Dawn: Oh... okay. Love you too, darling. Kiss the little one for me when she gets in from school.

Kelsey taps the red button. Silence falls on the room.

Kelsey: (Exhales loudly) Jesus.

Dave: Hard work.

Kelsey: Yeah. You okay?

Dave: Neck.

Kelsey: I know. Let's get the collar o

---

Setting: The living room, moments after the FaceTime call ended. The silence is heavy, broken only by the TV news on low volume showing footage of muddy water rushing through a town centre. Kelsey is standing by the coffee table, staring at the blank iPad screen, her shoulders tight. Dave is slumped, his head resting awkwardly against the wing of the chair.

(Time: 00:00)

Kelsey tosses the iPad onto the sofa. It lands with a soft thud. She rubs her temples.

Kelsey: "Is he feverish?" Honestly. Every time. Like I wouldn't notice if you were burning up.

Dave watches her. He wants to explain that his mum is just scared, but the energy cost is too high. He focuses on the physical discomfort instead.

Dave: (Low grunt) Hhhhg.

Kelsey: (Turning immediately) What? Pain?

Dave: Slide. Down.

Kelsey: You’ve slid down? Okay.

She walks over. She doesn't smile. She looks professional, efficient, but weary. She stands in front of him, grabbing the sheet under his thighs.

Kelsey: I need you to try and push with your feet. On three. One, two, three.

Dave pushes. It’s a pathetic amount of force, barely a twitch. Kelsey takes the brunt of the dead weight, hauling him upright. She exhales a sharp breath of exertion.

Dave: (Winded) Heavy. Sorry.

Kelsey: (Straightening up, rubbing her lower back) You’re not heavy, D. It’s just... dead weight. It’s physics.

Dave: Heavy... burden.

Kelsey: Don’t start. I’m talking about mass, not metaphor.

(Time: 00:08)

Kelsey sits on the ottoman in front of him to check his feet. On the TV, a reporter in waders is pointing at a submerged post office.

Kelsey: Look at that. Half of Derbyshire is underwater.

Dave: (Looking at TV) Bad.

Kelsey: At least we’re on a hill.

Dave isn't looking at the TV anymore. He’s looking at the top of Kelsey’s head as she adjusts his socks.

Dave: Mum... she... she struggles.

Kelsey: (Without looking up) She struggles? I’m the one interpreting mumbles while holding an iPad and checking your skin, Dave. She just has to sit there and knit.

There is a sharp edge to her voice. Dave winces slightly.

Dave: I know. I know... she’s... work.

Kelsey: She is work. Emotional work. I haven't got the bandwidth for her tears today. I really haven't.

Dave: (Takes a deep breath, tries a full sentence) I wish... I could... talk to her... myself.

Kelsey: (Looking up at him) I know you do.

Dave: Save you... the trouble.

Kelsey: It’s not just the talking, Dave. It’s the management. "Don't panic, Dawn," "He's fine, Dawn." It’s exhausting.

(Time: 00:15)

Dave looks away, towards the window. The guilt is a physical pressure in his chest. He hates being the cause of this friction.

Dave: Guilty.

Kelsey: What?

Dave: Feel... guilty.

Kelsey: (Softening, sighs) Stop it. It’s not your fault your mum is high maintenance.

Dave: Not her. You.

Kelsey pauses. She rests her hands on his knees.

Dave: You do... everything. Voice. Nurse. Wife.

Kelsey: Well. That’s the job description, isn't it? "In sickness and in health."

Dave: Too much. (He shakes his head slightly, the brace creaking) Too... much.

Kelsey: It is too much. I’m not going to lie and say it’s a breeze. But what’s the alternative?

Dave: Care... home?

Kelsey: (Sharp) Don’t. We are not discussing that. Not today.

(Time: 00:22)

The room goes quiet again. The TV reporter is interviewing a crying woman holding a cat carrier. Kelsey watches it, her eyes glazing over.

Kelsey: Look at her. Lost her whole ground floor. Puts things in perspective, I suppose.

Dave: No.

Kelsey: No?

Dave: (Intense stare) Your... flood. Is here.

He gestures awkwardly with his chin towards the medical equipment, the hoist, the mess of the room.

Dave: Drowning. You.

Kelsey looks at him. Her eyes well up, just a little, but she blinks it away. She reaches out and fixes the strap on his neck brace, a tender, automatic gesture.

Kelsey: I’m treading water, D. I’m not drowning yet.

Dave: Felt like... it. Just now.

Kelsey: I just... I needed her to be the mum for five minutes. You know? I wanted her to ask how I was. But she was too busy looking at your heel.

Dave: Selfish. She is.

Kelsey: She’s scared. I get it. But yeah. A bit selfish.

(Time: 00:30)

Kelsey stands up. She shakes her arms out, resetting herself.

Kelsey: Right. Pity party over. My daughter will be home in twenty minutes and if she sees me crying she’ll think the goldfish died.

Dave: (A ghost of a smile) Goldfish... tough.

Kelsey: Tougher than us. You want the volume up on the disaster movie?

Dave: A bit.

Kelsey picks up the remote and nudges the volume up. The sound of rushing water fills the room.

Dave: Kelsey.

Kelsey: Yeah?

Dave: (Struggling for clarity) Thank... you. For... the voice.

Kelsey: (Squeezing his shoulder) You’re welcome. Even if I did edit out the swearing.

Dave: (Small exhale) Next time... keep it in.
